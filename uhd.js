//The Lifetime Supply Calculator
//
//Ever wonder how much a "lifetime supply" of your favorite snack is? Wonder no more!
//
//    Write a function named calculateSupply that:
//        takes 2 arguments: age, amount per day.
//        calculates the amount consumed for rest of the life (based on a constant max age).
//        outputs the result to the screen like so: "You will need NN to last you until the ripe old age of X" 
//    Call that function three times, passing in different values each time.
//    Bonus: Accept floating point values for amount per day, and round the result to a round number. 

/*const calculateSupply = (age, ammount) => {
    const hundred = 100;
    const maxAge = 100 - age;
    const snacks = (ammount * 365) * maxAge;

}

/*TO DO

The Geometrizer

Create 2 functions that calculate properties of a circle, using the definitions here.

Create a function called calcCircumfrence:

    Pass the radius to the function.
    Calculate the circumference based on the radius, and output "The circumference is NN". 

Create a function called calcArea:

    Pass the radius to the function.
    Calculate the area based on the radius, and output "The area is NN". 

Problem 2

The Temperature Converter

It's hot out! Let's make a converter based on the steps here.

Create a function called celsiusToFahrenheit:

    Store a celsius temperature into a variable.
    Convert it to fahrenheit and output "NN째C is NN째F". 

Create a function called fahrenheitToCelsius:

    Now store a fahrenheit temperature into a variable.
    Convert it to celsius and output "NN째F is NN째C." */
